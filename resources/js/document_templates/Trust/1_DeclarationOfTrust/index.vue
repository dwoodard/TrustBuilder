      <p>
        It is expressly declared that a contractual agreement is hereby established between two parties for the benefit of a third party. This type of entity, created under Common Law Right of Contract, is known by several names, including a
        <b>Pure Trust Organization</b>, an <b>Irrevocable Declaration of Trust</b> and an
        <b>Unincorporated Business Trust Organization</b>, hereafter referred to as TRUST. This is not to be misconstrued as a living trust, a partnership, a company, a corporation, a joint venture, a limited partnership, a limited liability company or any other type of statutory entity established by privilege with a federal, state, county or municipal authority.

      <p>Although multiple copies of this Trust Document may exist, the only true version is the one held by the FIRST TRUSTEE. Any other version is merely a copy thereof and should not be legally relied upon for validity.

      <p class="text-center">DECLARATION OF TRUST</p>

      <p>
        This Declaration of Trust Agreement, Conveyance and Acceptance is created and entered into this
        <span class="preview-field">{{ moment(document_created_at).format('Do [day of] MMMM [A.D.], YYYY') }}</span>, between <span class="preview-field"><b>{{ settlor }}</b></span>, hereinafter called the SETTLOR and
        <span class="preview-field"> <b>{{ first_trustee }}</b> </span>, hereinafter called the TRUSTEE, and also known as the FIRST TRUSTEE, for the sole benefit of one or more BENEFICIARIES, who shall be named in the Trust Indenture Schedule B & Meeting Minute No. 2.
      </p>

      <p>The TRUST is authorized to exist and function through its Board of Trustees, hereafter BOARD, who are one or more legal persons holding fee simple title, not differentiating between legal and equitable, not as individuals, but collectively as the BOARD who shall operate the TRUST as a <b>PURE TRUST ORGANIZATION</b> under the artificial entity name of:</p>

      <p class="text-h6 text-center">
        <span class="preview-field">{{ trust_name }}</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        The entity, being domiciled in the jurisdiction of the Republic of Florida, pursuant to Florida Statute 609.01, within the united States of America, shall be managed by the BOARD acting in a fiduciary capacity for the use and benefit of the BENEFICIARY.
      </p>

      <p>
        This artificial entity hereby stands on its own, holds any and all of its assets in its own name and unlike a corporation, is not owned by another person or entity. It survives on its own, being fully accountable on its own accord. However, a natural living, breathing person must directly or indirectly sign on behalf of this entity in a fiduciary capacity as Trustee.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment the SETTLOR funds the Trust by contributing its first assets via the control of the Trustee, it breathes artificial life into the entity so that it may stand and act on its own, in its own name, solely responsible for its own actions as would a natural living, breathing person.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nothing contained herein shall be construed as intent to evade or contravene any law, nor to delegate any special power belonging exclusively to company law or a corporation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Declaration of Trust shall describe only the highlights of the roles and responsibilities of the two parties herein and the terms and conditions set out for the maintenance of the Trust. Only this Declaration of Trust may be made available to third parties at the sole discretion of the Board. The full set of operating instructions shall be detailed in the Trust Indenture and is privy only to the two parties to this private contract or as otherwise deemed prudent by the Board.
      </p>

      <div class="grey lighten-2 pa-2 text-center">
        TERM & INTENT OF TRUST
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>1. The Trust shall exist for a term of <span class="preview-field">{{ numberToEnglish(term_of_trust) }} ({{ term_of_trust }})</span> years from the date of inception (effective date of this Agreement) and the BOARD may, at any time before the Trust's expiration, extend its term.</li>
        <li>2. The organizational purpose of the TRUST is to sustain and improve the TRUST proactively through any means or business so that the BENEFICIARY may possess the things of life sufficient to provide for growth, health, protection, education, refinement, pro-creation, recreation, welfare, expansion, preservation and continuation and not simply an arrangement to protect and conserve the property for the BENEFICIARY.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div class="grey lighten-2 ma-2 pa-2 text-center">
        SETTLOR'S PROVISIONS & RESPONSIBILITIES
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>3. As consideration, the SETTLOR hereby irrevocably assigns and/or conveys as an absolute gift to the BOARD, in trust, certain properties and/or assets to be held in the name and ownership of the Trust and not by any TRUSTEE, the nature, identity and description of which are presently known to both the SETTLOR and the BOARD, and which shall be further identified and described in the Trust Indenture in which the BENEFICIARY(ies) shall NOT have a vested interest, until termination of the TRUST and final distribution of accumulated assets or any early distribution thereof by the BOARD at their sole discretion at any time during the term of the TRUST.</li>
        <li>4. The SETTLOR agrees and covenants that he shall have no further role to administer or make decisions as to the management of the TRUST after the effective date of the TRUST. He also affirms that he has no authority to change any portion of the Trust documents in any manner, nor shall he reserve or retain any dominion or control over the principal or income of the TRUST. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as conferring power upon the SETTLOR to reacquire Trust Corpus, or any part thereof by substituting other property of an equivalent value. The moment the SETTLOR signs this private contract, his duties and responsibilities related to the TRUST are completed.</li>
        <li>5. If the SETTLOR performs any role for the TRUST after his/her signing, it can only be in an arm's length relationship via an independent contractor relationship and have nothing to do with direct management functions of the TRUST. If the contracted functions involve any portion of TRUST assets, they must be free of sole discretion over ownership, control or disposition of those assets.</li>
        <li>6. The SETTLOR may, at any time in the future, assign and/or convey additional assets to the TRUST as additional consideration. Additionally, any outside party, including the BOARD or BENEFICIARY, may convey assets to the TRUST by gift, will, exchange, bill of sale, quit claim or by deed, with the consent of the BOARD, to be held for the benefit of the BENEFICIARY with the intent of eventually being distributed to the BENEFICIARY. The title to any assets accepted by the BOARD shall be held in a fiduciary capacity in the name of the TRUST and can only be claimed by the BENEFICIARY to have beneficial, not vested, ownership in those assets.</li>
      </ul>


      <div class="grey lighten-2 ma-2 pa-2 text-center">
        TRUSTEE'S PROVISIONS & RESPONSIBILITIES
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>7. Because the FIRST TRUSTEE may be just one person on the BOARD, in such instance, the words FIRST TRUSTEE or TRUSTEE can also be referred to hereafter as the BOARD. The FIRST TRUSTEE alone is always considered the BOARD but if other titled officers are also on the BOARD, the BOARD does not always only mean the FIRST TRUSTEE.</li>
        <li>
          8. The BOARD accepts said conveyed assets into the name and ownership of the Trust and not any TRUSTEE's name and the BOARD presents its own consideration for the Trust Agreement. The BOARD presents its expertise and knowledge in business and/or as a Trust Manager and shall administer the SETTLOR's wishes in establishing the artificial entity and maintaining it for the sole benefit of the BENEFICIARY who is listed in <b>Schedule B</b> of the Trust Indenture & in <b>Meeting Minute Number 2</b>.
        </li>
        <li>9. The BOARD is authorized to deal with the SETTLOR "at arm's length,‚Äù to purchase property or to sell property, but always at fair market value and for adequate and full consideration.</li>
        <li>10. The BOARD shall, as it deems proper and necessary, provide for operating funds through any type of borrowing, hypothecation, monetization either unsecured or directly or indirectly secured, which shall constitute the operating funds of the TRUST. The BOARD may authorize liquidation of assets for the purpose of adding to said operating funds.</li>
        <li>11. The BOARD shall have all the powers necessary to operate, manage and control the TRUST for the benefit of the BENEFICIARY and shall take any action which it deems necessary and proper to carry out such purposes, provided however, that the BOARD shall not possess any power or take any action contrary to law or inconsistent with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust.</li>
        <li>12. The BOARD shall receive reasonable compensation for their services performed. Any BOARD member may hold two or more offices simultaneously within the TRUST and be deserving of such reasonable compensation for all services rendered at the discretion of the BOARD. However, all BOARD members, Trust Manager(s), other titled officers and executives shall have the right to waive any compensation for their services.</li>
        <li>13. No member of the BOARD shall possess or exercise a power of administration in a nonfiduciary capacity, nor a power exercisable solely by himself to vest the corpus or the income therefrom in himself, or any other power, the possession or exercise of which would cause the income of the Trust to be taxed to any member of the BOARD or to the SETTLOR</li>
        <li>14. The BOARD shall, in their fiduciary capacity for the TRUST and not as individuals, assume or incur only such liability as shall attach to the Trust assets. This liability shall not in any manner jeopardize their individual or personal holdings and for any losses they should suffer for any reason through rendering services as the BOARD, they shall be reimbursed from the TRUST assets to the same extent as would non-interested persons, except for any loss sustained by reason of breach of their fiduciary duty.</li>
        <li>15. The BOARD may assign additional members to this TRUST as they deem necessary and prudent and they may increase or decrease the number of BOARD members as appropriate to the affairs of the TRUST. Said additional members may be necessary for the administration of various tasks associated with this TRUST and not necessarily for additional management decisions unless noted to the contrary in a separate Meeting Minute at the time said additional members are assigned. The appointment term for an additional member is controlled to one (1) year increments and can be withdrawn at any time by the FIRST TRUSTEE in a future Meeting Minute. An annual appointment renewal may only be authorized by the FIRST TRUSTEE within thirty (30) days or less prior to expiration of said member's appointment.</li>
        <li>16. Any additional TRUSTEES shall be referred to as SECONDARY TRUSTEES. Unless further clarified at the time of their appointment, the FIRST TRUSTEE shall, from time-to-time, designate specific tasks, roles, duties and/or authorities for which the SECONDARY TRUSTEE shall be consulted or kept apprised</li>
        <li>17. All decisions for the management of this TRUST need not be unanimous if more than one TRUSTEE is on the BOARD unless noted to the contrary in this TRUST INDENTURE or in a subsequent Meeting Minute. The FIRST TRUSTEE's decision shall always take priority over any other title if there is dissent. Only a FIRST TRUSTEE can make a decision with their sole signature unless that specific authority is additionally passed down to another title / person on the BOARD in writing (Meeting Minute, Trust Resolution or otherwise).</li>
        <li>18. Even if there are other currently active Board members, the First Trustee, or equivalent, shall always retain the sole authority, at his/her sole discretion, to amend this Declaration of Trust and/or its corresponding Trust Indenture in any reasonable manner in order to carry out the intended functions of the Board. Said functions can include, but are not limited to, clarifying or rectifying any situation or circumstance of the past, present or future that has not already been addressed therein.</li>
        <li>19. Any BOARD member shall abstain from voting if benefiting personally or in any other manner from the transaction.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="grey lighten-2 ma-2 pa-2 text-center">
        ADDITIONAL TRUSTEES, MANAGERS, OFFICERS & CONTRACTORS
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>20. The BOARD may employ, hire or contract with, and pay from the TRUST assets, reasonable compensation to any officer, assistant, aide, contractor, subcontractor, agent, clerk, manager, TRUSTEE, attorney, barrister, solicitor, accountant, broker, investment, tax or other advisor as the BOARD deems necessary and prudent for the expedient and proper function of the TRUST.</li>
        <li>21. The BOARD shall, at its discretion, appoint one or more of its TRUSTEES, or qualified non Trustees, to the position of Trust Manager(s). Said appointment will also require an appropriate Independent Contractor Agreement to be on file for said title to become effective. Unless otherwise noted, the Trust Manager(s) shall have full authority to manage the TRUST including, but not limited to, the routine day-to-day operations, subject, at all times, to the scrutiny of the BOARD. If no Trust Manager is appointed, the FIRST TRUSTEE shall retain all management duties.</li>
        <li>22. No TRUSTEE, Trust Manager(s), or other titled officer, currently employed, hired or under contract with the TRUST, shall ever be held liable for any action or default of any TRUSTEE, Trust Manager, other titled officer, or any other person in connection with the administration and management of this TRUST unless caused by the individual's own gross negligence or by commission of a willful act of breach of trust.</li>

        <li>28. The BOARD shall initiate or defend, at the BOARD's sole discretion, any litigation affecting the Trust. The BOARD may also submit to arbitration, compromise, release or otherwise adjust, with or without compensation, any and all claims affecting the TRUST.</li>

        CERTIFICATES OF BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF TRUST ASSETS
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>33. Each BENEFICIARY shall be assigned a number of Units of Beneficial Ownership (hereafter UNITS) between one (1) and one hundred (100), of which the sum total of all UNITS shall equal one hundred (100). Said number shall similarly represent the percentage of all TRUST assets to which said BENEFICIARY may claim beneficial ownership. Each UNIT shall represent one percent (1%) of all TRUST assets. There shall never be more or less than 100 UNITS available to the BENEFICIARY(ies).</li>
        <li>34. A Certificate of Beneficial Ownership (hereafter CERTIFICATE) shall be issued to each BENEFICIARY stating the number of UNITS said BENEFICIARY is entitled to claim. If said BENEFICIARY is a minor or an adult of questionable mental stability, said CERTIFICATE may be held by the BOARD or entrusted with the BENEFICIARY's parent or legal guardian as the situation may apply, at the discretion of the BOARD.</li>

        <li>36. A Replacement BENEFICIARY shall retain only those rights previously held by a predecessor BENEFICIARY. </li>
        <li>37. The holding of a CERTIFICATE does not entitle the BENEFICIARY or a HOLDER to any management power or rights. Nor shall the death of a BENEFICIARY, or transfer by a BENEFICIARY or a HOLDER, entitle his heirs, legal representatives, or transferees to demand any division of the property of the TRUST, any special accounting thereof, or entitlement to any special rights whatsoever.</li>

It is imperative that no representative of the TRUST (TRUSTEE, Trust Manager, or other titled officer, etc.) disclose to any member of the general public, private business or counsel, any information pertaining to the BENEFICIARY.
